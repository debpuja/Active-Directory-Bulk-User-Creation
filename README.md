Credits for home lab: JM[link github] [link YT video]

For this project I wanted to demonstrate my ability to set up an Active Directory using Oracle VirtualBox with Powershell Automation, Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10.

When setting this lab up, I downloaded Oracle VirtualBox, Windows Server 2019 ISO, and Windows 10 ISO. 

I set up the domain controller first within VirtualBox. I configured NAT on there. 

I configured user home directories

I ran the scripts for user creations suing Powershell Automation.

I configured DHCP srvices.

I shared folders wihtin the user group. 

I also configured group policy settings. 

PowerShell Automation: Josh demonstrates how to efficiently add over 1,000 users to the Active Directory using PowerShell scripts. This automation streamlines the process and is essential for managing large user bases.
