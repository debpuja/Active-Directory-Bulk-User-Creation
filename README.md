<h2>Objectives</h2>
For this project I want to demonstrate my ability to set up an Active Directory using Oracle VirtualBox with Powershell Automation, Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10. Setting up and Active Directory security is critical for organizations. Setting up a test environment within a sandbox allows for experimenting with security configurations, testing security policies, and conducting penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

- <b>Windows Server 2019</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>


#Steps
When setting this lab up, I downloaded Oracle VirtualBox, Windows Server 2019 ISO, and Windows 10 ISO. 

I set up the domain controller first within VirtualBox. I configured NAT on there. 

I configured user home directories

I ran the scripts for user creations suing Powershell Automation.

I configured DHCP srvices.

I shared folders wihtin the user group. 

I also configured group policy settings. 

PowerShell Automation: Josh demonstrates how to efficiently add over 1,000 users to the Active Directory using PowerShell scripts. This automation streamlines the process and is essential for managing large user bases.
